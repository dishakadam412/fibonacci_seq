# 🐚 Fibonacci Sequence Generator

Welcome to my **Fibonacci Sequence** project!
The **Fibonacci sequence** is a famous pattern where each number is the sum of the two before it.
It goes like this:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...

This project **generates** the Fibonacci sequence for however many numbers you want.

## ✨ What This Project Does

- Asks you how many Fibonacci numbers you want
- Generates the sequence
- Prints it out nicely
- Super fast. Super simple. Super cool. 😎

## 🧠 Example

Input: 10

Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

## 🧩 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

- Start with the first two numbers: **0** and **1**
- Add them to get the next number
- Keep repeating the addition
- Stop when we’ve generated the amount you asked for

## 💡 Future Ideas (If I Feel Fancy)

- Add a graph that shows the Fibonacci curve 📈
- Make a website version
- Add explanations of the golden ratio 🌟
